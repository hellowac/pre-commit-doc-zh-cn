# Contributing

=== "中文"

=== "英文"

We’re looking to grow the project and get more contributors especially to
support more languages/versions. We’d also like to get the
.pre-commit-hooks.yaml files added to popular linters without maintaining
forks / mirrors.

Feel free to submit bug reports, pull requests, and feature requests.
